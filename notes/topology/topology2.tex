\section{Homotopy}
\begin{defi}
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ and $(Y, \mathcal{S})$ be topology spaces,
$f, g : X \to Y$ are both continuous,
$f$ and $g$ are homotopic if there is a continuous function
$F : X \times I \to Y$ such that $F(x, 0) = f(x)$
and $F(0, 1) = g(x)$ for all $x \in X$, denoted by $f \simeq g$.
\end{defi}

\begin{pro}
$\simeq$ is an equivalent relation on the set of continuous functions $X \to Y$.
\end{pro}


\section{Foundament Group}
 A path is a continuous function $\gamma: [0, 1] \to X$.
