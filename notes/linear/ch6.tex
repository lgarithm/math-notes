From this section we are going to invesgate the linear spaces from functional analysis.

\subsection{Linear Topology Space}
A linear topology space is a linear space with a topology such that
$x \to \lambda x$ and $(x, y) \to x + y$ are continuous.

\subsection{Banach Space}
A metric space is a set $X$ with a distance function $d : X \times X \to \mathbb R$,
which is
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item $d(x, y) \neq 0$
\item $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$
\item $d(x, y) = 0$ iif $x = y$
\item $d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z)$
\end{enumerate}

A metric space is complete is every Cauchy sequence in that space converges.

A norm of a linear space is a function $n : X \to \mathbb R$ such that
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item $n(x) \geq 0$
\item $n(\lambda x) = \abs{\lambda} n(x)$
\item $n(x + y) \leq n(x) + n(y)$
\item $n(x) = 0$ iff $x = 0$
\end{enumerate}

If $n : X \to \mathbb R$ is a norm in $X$, 
the function $d : X \times X \to \mathbb R$ definde by $d(x, y) = n(x - y)$ makes $X$ into a metric space.

A complete normaed linear space is called a Banach space. 

\subsection{Hilbert Space}
Let $V$ be a $K$-linear space, an inner product is a bilinear form $V \times V \to K$.
When $K = \mathbb R$, and $(x, y) \geq 0$, an inner product defines a norm on $V$,
