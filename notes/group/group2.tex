\section{Presentation of a Group}
The presentation of a group, is to describe a group by generators and relations.
\begin{defi}[presentation]
Let $S$ be a set, called the generators,
$R$ is a relation on the free group generated by $S$,
then $\gen{S \mid R}$ is called presentation of $G$ if $G \cong S / R$.
\end{defi}
The relation $R$ is usually given by some expressions like $ab = c$, where $a, b, c \in S$.
Which means $ab$ equals to $c$ in the quotient group.
Each relation can be re-written as $s_1s_2 \cdots s_i = e$, e.g. $abc^{-1} = e$, 
so that $R$ can be considered a subset of the free group generated by $S$.
Recall that a normal subgroup $H$ of any 
group $G$ defines an equivalent relation on $G$ by $x \sim y$ if and only if $xy^{-1} \in H$,
and each equivalent class is a coset of $H$. The group generated by generators $S$ and relation 
$R$ is just the quotient group of the free group generated by $S$ modulo the normal subgroup 
generated by $R$.

\section{Direct Product and Decomposition}
\begin{defi}[direct product]
Let $H, K$ be groups, the direct product of $H$ and $K$, is $H \bigoplus K = \{(h, k) \mid h \in H, k \in K\}$,
$(h_1, k_1)(h_2, k_2) = (h_1h_2, k_1k_2)$ and $(h, k)^{-1} = (h^{-1}, k^{-1})$.
\end{defi}
For sets, the Cartesian product is not commutative, i.e. $X \times Y \neq Y \times X$,
but for groups, we have $H \bigoplus K \cong K \bigoplus H$.
\begin{thm}
Let $G$ be an abelian group, $H, K \leq G$, $HK \cong H \bigoplus K$ if and only if $H \cap K = \{1_G\}$.
\end{thm}
\begin{prf}
Observe the full homomorphism $(h, k) \to hk$ is single if and only if $H \cap K = \{1_G\}$.
\end{prf}

\section{Abelian Group}
We prove the structure theorems for finite abelian group.

\begin{thm}
Let $G$ be a finite abelian group,
$$G = \bigoplus_{p \mid \abs{G}} pG$$
where $pG = \{g \mid p^ng = 1\}$
\end{thm}

\section{Topological Group}
A topological group is a group with topology such that the maps
$-1 : G \to G$ and $\circ : G \times G \to G$ given by
$x \to x^{-1}$ and $(x, y) \to xy$ are continuous.
