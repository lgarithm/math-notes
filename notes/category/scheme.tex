\section{Presheaf and Sheaf}
Let $(\mathcal T, X)$ be a topology space, then $\mathcal T$ is made
into a category if we let $\Hom(U, V)$ contains only the inclusion map
for open sets $U \subseteq V$. Denote this category by $\mathcal O(X)$.

A presheaf is a cofuncor $\mathcal F$ from $\mathcal O(x)$ to another categoty $\mathcal K$.
common studied presheaves are presheaf of abelian group and presheaf of commutative ring.
