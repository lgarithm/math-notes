\section{Commutative Kernel}
Let $\Sigma$ be and alphbeta, then $\Sigma^\ast$ is a free monoid generated by $\Sigma$.
Let $M$ be the free abelian monoid generated by $\Sigma$, then there is a natural morphism 
$s : \Sigma^\ast \to M$, for $w \in \Sigma^\ast$, $s(w)$ sort the letters in $w$ and group 
the same letters together. $M$ = $\Sigma^\ast / (\Sigma^2)$, i.e., the quotient of $M$ by
the full relation $\Sigma^2$. 

Give a order on $\Sigma$, we hava a canonical embed of $M$ in $\Sigma^\ast$, $i : M \to \Sigma^\ast$. 


$M$ also can be view as the free $\mathbb Z$-module with basis $\Sigma$.

Now we consider the image of a morphism $\phi$ under $s$. 
For $\phi(\sigma_i) = w_i$, let $\psi(\sigma_i) = \abs{w_i}_{\sigma_1}\sigma_1 + \cdots + \abs{w_i}_{\sigma_n} \sigma_n$,
then $\psi$ becomes a linear transform on $M$.
